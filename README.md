update as of 2-25-26: the revanced team has confimed my suspicion, they are constantly checking the licenses and values of the client with the server and if anything doesnt match they wait 5 mins and shut downthe app and blacklist the account.

heres what i know: they do periodic checks to see what attributes the client is reporting, if the client reports as premium but the servers database says premium it send a pushka-tokens delete command and revokes the token
